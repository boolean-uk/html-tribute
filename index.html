        He began his career in 2015 under the name <b>JuicetheKidd</b>. At the time he was only in high school, but he already demonstrated to be an excelent freestyler and to have a great ability to write songs. He became known worldwide through SoundCloud in 2017 to 2018, now as <b>Juice WRLD</b>, for what are his biggest hits til this day: "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzB1VGEGcSU" target="_blank">Lucid Dreams</a>" and "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3EJICKwITw" target="_blank">All Girls Are The Same</a>", which both debuted in the top 1 and 2 of the Billboard Hot 100. In the midst of his great success, he signed his first contract with the record label Grade A and released his first album called <em><a style="color: blue;" href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_npIYOGK225kYobY4DZt3YGJCYihQf1yVU" target="_blank">Goodbye & Good Riddance</a></em>, which included the two great hits mentioned, in addition to other songs such as: "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SejM_hBvMM" target="_blank">Lean wit Me</a>", "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiO8wV4-wc" target="_blank">Wasted</a>", and "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr82wSBZeeQ" target="_blank">Armed & Dangerous</a>". Due to too many hits made, this album became a classic in the world of rap. After so much success in a such short time, he released his second album called <em><a style="color: blue;" href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kgh_mETIeWagnD5BgaD93PM3z9K9uxObg" target="_blank">Death Race for Love</a></em>, in 2019.

        Unfortunately, on December 8, 2019, he suffered a seizure at Chicago Midway Airport, managed to be taken to the hospital but did not survived. After his death, two posthumous albums were released, the first, <em><a style="color: blue;" href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kwSFpSgVWClQPCf-wK6Q1J8m8fDr4SrKM" target="_blank">Legends Never Die</a></em> in 2020, which became the most successful posthumous debut and for the most U.S top ten entries from one album, and <em><a style="color: blue;" href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nPjR6XDJOlRASCRaL45vsc2MbJNno14Pg" target="_blank">Fighting Demons</a></em>, that was released in 2021, alongside the documentary film <em><a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.hbo.com/movies/music-box-juice-wrld-into-the-abyss" target="_blank">Juice Wrld: Into the Abyss</a></em>, which contained the US top 20 single "<a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f74GYIVMk3I" target="_blank">Already Dead</a>".

    <p><b>Jarad</b> grew up in the South Suburbs of Chicago, in Calumet Park. He then moved to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School and graduated in 2017.<br/><br/> 
      His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his father left, leaving his mother to raise him alone. At four, he learned to play piano, inspired by his mother. Then he took up the guitar and drums while also playing the turumpet for band class. As Jarad's mother was very religious, she prohibeted him to listen to hip hop. In the other hand, he was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, which would become one of his most type songs geners besides rap.<br/><br/> 
      As he wasn't allowed to listen to rap music at home, he started to listen with his friends outside, then to realise his ability in freestyling. Back that time, he was also a heavy drug user. In his musics, he said that started doing Percocet, Lean and Xanax already in 2013. In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to SoundCloud, which he recorded on his smartphone. <b>Jarad</b> began to take rapping more seriously.</p>

      On December 8, 2019, Juice was aboard his jet in Los Angeles to Midway Airport in Chicago. Law enforcement officers were waiting for the jet to arrive, having been notified by federal agents, while the flight was en route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. Law enforcement officials later revealed that they found 70 lb (32 kg) of marijuana on the aircraft and said several members of <b>Higgins</b>' management team aboard the flight told them that <b>Higgins</b> had taken "several unknown pills", including allegedly swallowing multiple Percocet pills to hide them while police were on board the plane searching the luggage.<br/><br/> 
      Til this day, too many people that were in that jet talked about what happened, but this statement was never proven right. Chris Long, Juice's cameraman, talked about that night and said "he was addicted but not dumb to take pills in a attempt of hiding the drugs". There were too many drugs, it was impossible to hide. In fact, Chris said Juice was calm and didn't appear anytime to care about being arrested.<br/><br/> 
      Continuing, suddenly, <b>Higgin</b> then began convulsing and seizing, after which two doses of the emergency medication naloxone were administered as an opioid overdose was suspected. Chicago PD were told a man (Higgins) had suffered a medical emergency at around 2:00 local time (8:00 GMT). <b>Higgins</b> was transported to the nearby Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead around at 3:15 a.m. On January 22, 2020, the Cook County Medical Examiner stated that <b>Higgins</b> died as a result of toxic levels of oxycodone and codeine present in his system.
