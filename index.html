        Classic and Vintage car collecting is not for small hobby enthusiasts
        but is part of understanding American and world history and the
        revolution of the industrial era. Enthusiasts are not only interested in
        collecting cars but are passionate about classic and vintage cars and
        the stories of how they were developed with each unique models’ role in
        history. They like to collect, restore and even drive these antique
        pieces of engineering. This interest is both expensive and rare, making
        it equally unique. A vintage car is defined as cars manufactured between
        1919 and 1930. Though there are debates on the start and end dates of
        this era, the most prevalent period for vintage cars lies somewhere
        within the era of World War I of mostly sport and classy looks blended
        with ahead-of-time technology. With heavy engines, glaring bodies and
        rock solid strength, these cars are what makes a classic car. Cars that
        are 20 to 45 years old fall under the category of classic cars. Classic
        cars manufactured in America are called American Classic cars. Different
        American clubs hold several meets from time to time to celebrate the
        rarity and class of old cars. There were three major vintage car
        manufacturers in America (in 1930): Ford, Hudson and Chevrolet. Buying a
        classic or vintage car can be a very rewarding experience. A well
        maintained classic car can bring beauty and pride to owners, and wonder
        to classic car lovers. However, in order to maintain the integrity of
        the classic car, it needs to be maintained and restored to a level that
        as closely resembled the original as possible.

      <h2 class="centered">History</h2>
      <p class="spaced-lines">
        The classic car era, spanning from the early 20th century to the
        mid-20th century, gave birth to some of the most iconic automobiles in
        history. These cars were not just means of transportation; they were
        works of art They are usually older cars, typically 25 years or older,
        though definitions vary.A common theme is of an older car of historical
        interest to be collectible and tend to be restored rather than scrapped,
        though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered
        a subset of a broader category of "collector cars" (which includes both
        restored classic cars vehicles and newer exotic vehicles). A subset of
        what is considered classic cars are known as antique cars (manufactured
        before 1980) or vintage cars.Organizations such as the Classic Car Club
        of America (CCCA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars that are
        called "classic". These are described as "fine" or "distinctive"
        automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and
        1948.
